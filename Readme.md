# Chording Model

This repo contains scripts that use word lists to analyze chording keyboard designs. Chorded keyboards are keyboards where one presses multiple keys at a time to type entire syllables or words in one stroke.

I've used it to model the efficiency of the [Velotype](http://velotype.com/en/) layout and do some basic research into generating an optimal layout.
