## Attempt 2
Try pair with high frequency, then a low frequency pair for doubles.

["lmn", "dft", 29.259999999999998, 13.54, 15.719999999999999]
["svw", "grx", 0.009580517791156798, 17.7, 9.48, 8.219999999999999]
sum: 47

["nrx", "dmt", 29.17, 13.139999999999999, 16.03]

Trying high freq, then pairs that don't conflict with leftovers
["lmn", "dft", 29.259999999999998, 13.54, 15.719999999999999]
["jqv", "bsw", 0.03475060148039001, 11.18, 1.32, 9.86]
sum: 40
